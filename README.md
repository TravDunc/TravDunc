# Travis Duncan
**Security Platform Engineer | Cloud GRC Automation**

I build security and compliance systems that scale with engineering velocity. My work focuses on embedding governance into CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and observability platforms—making compliance a byproduct of good engineering, not a bottleneck.

## What I'm Building

**AWS Security & Governance Automation**
- [Secure S3 Deployment with CloudFormation](https://github.com/TravDunc/AWS-CloudFormation-Secure-S3-Bucket) – IaC template with encryption, versioning, and compliance controls baked in

**Impact from Recent Work:**
- Reduced vulnerability index 63% (10.63 → 3.89) in 60 days for $7B AWS financial platform
- Automated vulnerability reporting with Python/PowerQuery, accelerating patching by 1-2 days weekly
- Prevented system authorization loss by reversing non-compliant policy for two mission-critical environments

## Technical Stack
**Cloud:** AWS (Config, Security Hub, IAM, SCPs, CloudFormation), Azure  
**Automation:** Python, PowerShell, AWS CLI, Infrastructure-as-Code  
**Security Frameworks:** NIST 800-53, RMF, ISO 27001, SOC, CIS Benchmarks  
**Data Engineering:** SQL, Excel PowerQuery, ETL pipelines

## Background
8+ years securing cloud infrastructure and leading GRC programs. Former US Air Force cybersecurity leader managing 34,000 systems across $350M infrastructure. Now focused on building security platforms that enable teams to move fast without breaking compliance.
